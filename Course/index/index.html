<element id="green-background"> 
    With drops of Jupiter in her hair<br>
    She acts like summer and walks like rain<br>
    Reminds me that there's a time to change, hey<br>

            <h2> Since the return of her stay on the moon </h2>                <p> She listens like spring and she talks like June, hey<br>
    Hey, hey, yeah<br>
    But tell me, did you sail across the sun?<br>
    Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights all faded<br>
    And that Heaven is overrated?<br>
    And tell me, did you fall for a shooting star?<br>
    One without a permanent scar, and did you miss me<br>
    While you were looking for yourself out there? </p>

    <h3>Now that she's back from that soul vacation</h3>
    <p>Tracing her way through the constellation, hey, mmm<br>
    She checks out Mozart while she does Tae-Bo<br>
    Reminds me that there's a room to grow, hey, yeah </p>
